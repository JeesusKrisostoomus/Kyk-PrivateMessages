# Kyk-PrivateMessages
Simple resource to add private message command to your fivem server.
If you find any bugs/want to improve this resource you can either make a pull request/make a request in "Issues" or customise this resource to your liking.

If you do decide to make your own version of it then it would be nice if you credited me. Thanks and enjoy.

***Commands***
- pm 'target id' 'message' [Example: pm 21 Hello my friend. This is an example.]

***Other***
- If something isn't working for you then try turning on debug mode from the config and execute the command again that was giving you errors (Probably won't help but maybe).

- I won't be uploading it to CFX.re forums yet because i feel like this resource is not yet done and i could do alot more with it to make it actually worth publising it.
